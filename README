OVERVIEW

Another attempt to use the pointclouds in openFrameworks 

previous efforts 
https://github.com/jvcleave/PCL_1-3-0_Libraries_for_OF 
https://github.com/jvcleave/PCL_1-3-0_OF_Examples

Fork/use this at your own peril - it is quite large and I ultimately would like to get it into the format of PCL_1-3-0_Libraries_for_OF
However this is working with the latest OpenNI (if installed on the system) and may be helpful for someone trying to do something similar.


NOTES

Created using the PCL-1.4.0 source
http://dev.pointclouds.org/attachments/download/610/PCL-1.4.0-Source.tar.bz2

I did rename pcl/common/time.h in the source to pcl/common/pcl_common_time.h to avoid conflicts

REQUIREMENTS
libusb to be installed via OpenNI instructions 
https://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI/blob/master/README


OpenNI 1.5.2.23
Sensor-Bin-MacOSX-v5.1.0.41

Binaries should be fine
http://www.openni.org/Downloads/OpenNIModules.aspx

SensorKinect https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect

If you install Nite I recommend you do it last (particularly after the Sensor installs). This may be a known process but I didn't figure it out until multiple head-to-desk contacts.

Almost all of the project paths, etc are in Project.xcconfig if you want to use your own libraries

TODO:
Break out PCL, VTK, Boost, etc into seperate xcconfig files (Project.xcconfig is a rat's nest)

Break out PCL into a seperate Xcode project to be included (much like OF)

Try self-contained OpenNI libs similar to gameoverhack's versions in ofxOpenNI
